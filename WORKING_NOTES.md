## Session: August 15, 2026 - AA/AAA Practice Scheduling Fix

### Issue
BB AA and BB AAA leagues were not showing practices on Aug 31 and Sept 7 (both Mondays) during the pre-opening period.

### Root Causes Found

1. **Database values were swapped**: The `first_practice_date` and `opening_day_date` values were reversed in the database.
   - BB AAA had: `opening_day_date`=Aug 31, `first_practice_date`=Sept 14
   - Should be: `first_practice_date`=Aug 31, `opening_day_date`=Sept 14

2. **Scheduler logic bug**: The `_assign_practices_for_date` function only scheduled practices on practice days, even during the pre-opening period when practices should be scheduled on ALL activity days (game + practice days).

### Fixes Applied

1. **Database fix**: Updated `railway_backup.sql` and live database to swap the dates:
   - BB AAA: `first_practice_date`=2026-08-31, `opening_day_date`=2026-09-14
   - BB AA: `first_practice_date`=2026-09-01, `opening_day_date`=2026-09-17

2. **Scheduler fix** (`app/utils/scheduler.py`):
   - Added `is_pre_opening` parameter to `_assign_practices_for_date()` function
   - Pre-opening practices now skip the practice-day-only filter
   - Pre-opening logic passes `is_pre_opening=True` when calling the function

3. **Post-opening fix**: Also added logic to respect `first_practice_date` for post-opening practices (uses `max(opening_day, first_practice)` as start date).

### Semantic Clarification
- `first_practice_date`: Date when practices can BEGIN (earliest practice date)
- `opening_day_date`: Date when GAMES can start being scheduled

Before opening day, practices are scheduled on ALL activity days (game days + practice days).
After opening day, games are scheduled on game days and practices only on practice days.

### Files Modified
- `app/utils/scheduler.py` - Added `is_pre_opening` parameter and logic
- `railway_backup.sql` - Swapped date values for BB AAA and BB AA

### Testing
Verified that practices now generate correctly:
- BB AAA: Aug 31 (Mon), Sept 2 (Wed), Sept 4 (Fri), Sept 7 (Mon), Sept 9 (Wed), then scrimmage on Sept 11
- BB AA: Sept 1 (Tue), Sept 3 (Thu), Sept 5 (Sat), Sept 8 (Tue), etc.
